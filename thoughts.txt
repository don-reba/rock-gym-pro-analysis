implementation
	√ print today as YAML
	√ print 7 days as YAML
	√ run for an hour
		√ print a dot every minute
		√ save YAML at the end
	run for a week
		√ start a new line every hour
		√ start a new file each day
need exception handling
	print 'x' instead of '.' on errors
analysis
	√ figure out what the time slots are
		check that they are always the same
	calculate how soon each slot gets filled
		109 slots/week
	draw the time slots in Inkscape
		not sure how to visualize

questions
	how long does it take for each slot to fill?
		compute
			√ time first available
			√ time first full
			√ difference
		visualize
			divide into classes and colour
				use hex colours for colouring!
					though, these are problem-specific
					not hex-count-specific
				colours
					1: #2074FE
					2: #F2544F
					3: #FFD200
					4: #6B1099
					5: #FF8300
					6: #00C548
			display the exact time, also
	how likely is it for slots to become available?
		there is a week of availability for each slot
			when the slot is either open or full
			graph each and look for patterns
		visualize
			draw horizontal bars, one for each slot
			1080px leaves 9px for each of the 109 slots
				not enough for 1 min resolution horizontally
				168px enough for 1 hour resolution
		TODO
need to account for summer time
	available from: same day, same time, previous week
svg editing
	namespaces matter
