implementation
	√ print today as YAML
	√ print 7 days as YAML
	√ run for an hour
		√ print a dot every minute
		√ save YAML at the end
	run for a week
		√ start a new line every hour
		√ start a new file each day
need exception handling
	print 'x' instead of '.' on errors
analysis
	√ figure out what the time slots are
		check that they are always the same
	calculate how soon each slot gets filled
		109 slots/week
	draw the time slots in Inkscape
		not sure how to visualize

questions
	how long does it take for each slot to fill?
		√ compute
			√ time first available
			√ time first full
			√ difference
		√ visualize
			√ divide into classes and colour
				lightness: 67
			√ display the exact time, also
	how likely is it for slots to become available?
		there is a week of availability for each slot
			when the slot is either open or full
			graph each and look for patterns
		visualize
			draw horizontal bars, one for each slot
				1080px leaves 9px for each of the 109 slots
					981px total
				not enough for 1 min resolution horizontally
				168px enough for 1 hour resolution
				1008px for 10 minute resolution
			draw a density plot
				need R for this
					table with columns for slot and time
				could also compute it in Nemerle
					density plots are not terribly difficult
					this would make it pixel-perfect
					can reuse the Snaphappi code
		TODO
need to account for summer time
	available from: same day, same time, previous week
svg editing
	namespaces matter
		'//svg:g[@inkscape:label="mo"]'
		doc.at('//svg:rect[@id="rect12147"]')['style']
		style.gsub(/fill:[^;]*;/, 'fill:#DEFACE;')
slot timeline
	algorithm
		array of n minute slots
		for each "open" sample
			calculate which slot it's in
			mark it
		marking time
			there is no exact time
				the timelines are all shifted
			but dividing into 7 days would be informative
				can do it in Inkscape
	how to calculate slot
		slots start at a predefined time on Thursday
			when the first observed slot opened
			2021-03-11 19:00
	peak cancellations 1h before opening
how about polling BC backcountry reservations?

	TODO
sample < 1min
	pay an extra visit at random times within the minute
		maybe only during slot openings
			I don't know when the slot opens, exactly
	could be a whole separate script
		no need to interrupt the current one
	where to get the schedule
		from 'combined.json'
		schedule for each day of the week
		iterate for each slot in current day
	scheme
		loop
			sleep until several seconds before slot begins
			generate several random visits
			get data for those visits
				data only for the day a week from now
					only look at the correct slot
				record data reception time
			sleep until the next day
	I don't ever see slots full
		high change of no visits in latter parts of the range
		should pay 2 visits each minute with randomized delay
	TODO
duration statistics
	median duration is 5
	1/3 is 10 minutes or more
		1 - ecdf(durations$time)(9)
	30% is 2 minutes or less
	ecdf(2) = 30%
