implementation
	√ print today as YAML
	√ print 7 days as YAML
	√ run for an hour
		√ print a dot every minute
		√ save YAML at the end
	run for a week
		√ start a new line every hour
		√ start a new file each day
need exception handling
	print 'x' instead of '.' on errors
analysis
	√ figure out what the time slots are
		check that they are always the same
	calculate how soon each slot gets filled
		109 slots/week
	draw the time slots in Inkscape
		not sure how to visualize

questions
	how long does it take for each slot to fill?
		compute
			time first available
			time first full
			difference
	how likely is it for slots to become available?
		TODO
need to account for summer time
	available from: same day, same time, previous week
